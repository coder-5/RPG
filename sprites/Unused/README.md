# Unused Sprites

These sprites are not yet implemented in the game but may be used in future updates.

## Why Unused:

### Need Additional Game Mechanics:
- **Bridge_Wood.png** - Requires bridge crossing mechanics
- **Chest.png** - Requires loot/chest opening system
- **House_1_Wood_Base_Blue.png** - Already using simple building tiles
- **Fences.png** - Requires fence/boundary mechanics
- **Beach_Tile.png, Cliff_Tile.png, FarmLand_Tile.png** - Not used in current terrain generation
- **Water_Tile.png, Path_Tile.png, Grass_Tile.png** - Alternative tilesets

### Need Animation System:
- **Player_Actions.png** - Requires sprite animation system for actions

### Not Currently in Game Design:
- **Animals/** (Chicken, Cow, Pig, Sheep) - Could be future NPCs or decorations
- **Oak_Tree_Small.png** - Could be added as terrain decoration
- **Outdoor_Decor_Free.png** - Reference/sprite sheet

## Future Implementation:
These sprites can be implemented when the corresponding game mechanics are added.
